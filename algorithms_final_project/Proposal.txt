Project proposal
	The problem
		Project goals:
			This project aims to present multiple implements of solutions to the convex-hull problem in 3 dimensions and an indepth comprison of runtime.
		Algorithms implemented:
			Graham Scan, Jarvis March, divide-and-conquer convex-hull
		Problem solved by algorithm:
			3-d convex-hull for arbitrary selection of 3d points, consisting of x, y, and z float coordinates.
		Data set used for implementation:
			struct point{ float x, y, z;}
			int main(int argc, char **argv){
				std::vector<point> points;
				// randomly generated data sets of size 
			}
		Background knowledge, solved examples, etc.:
